		<h2>Process in Conducting Research and Testing</h2>
		<p>	The process in conducting the research and testing for my portfolio was relatively simple. For the User Research, I intereviewed my Co-Worker, Thomas Vu. The reason I interviewed him was because he has experience in web design and development so I feel like I could gain plenty of insight from him. Also, he was easily accessible and was willing to help me out in my research. For other parts of the research such as the Feature Value Matrix and so on, I simply looked through the internet for further insight and asked a couple of my friends what they would like to see in my portfolio and why. 
		<br/><br/>
		For User Testing, I simple asked a few of my friends to take a quick survey for me. They were all willing to help so I was able to get insight from 10 of them. Also, for the Cognitive Walkthrugh, I asked Thomas again since he is knowledgable. However, I decided to ask a few friends to test out my website as well and to imagine that they were trying to hire me to see what they would look for in a portfolio. Scheduling meetings were simple as they were all available and helped out when they had the opportunity.

	<div class =  "findings section-title container">
		<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
		<p> After completing the user research and testing, I have found that there are a few aspects my site can improve on. The main aspect is the design. As of now, my site could look more professional with a better design. Even though my site is unique, it lacks a professional sense which can be accomplished with some cleaning up. However, I have recieved notes that this is a solid starting point and I am not too far off from creating a nice, sleek portfolio. I have all the content a portfolio should contain, but now I need to update those information and elaborate a bit more on the content such as the programming experience. 
		<br/><br/>
		Research and testing had a few challenges. One of them was creating questions for the interviews. Me being a novice developer, I did not know what kind of questions to ask to help improve my portfolio. I wanted to keep it general and open so that I could receive constructive feedback for improvements. Another challenge was making time for the interview. I was extremely busy the past month so finding time to set-up an interview with my friends and co-worker was fairly difficult. Luckily, they were all available the same time I was.

	<div class = "incorporation section-title container">
		<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
		<p>	Although I have not incorporated any of my findings, I am planning to do so in the future. I want to have a nice, high-end portfolio for future employment opportunities. However, before I begin working on my portfolio, I want to begin learning more about coding and design. I feel like these aspects are important to create a better portfolio, so I would be starting with that. I want my portfolio to incorporate as much of my knowledge as possible in order to hopefully get hired in the future. 

		<br/><br/>
		Besides learning about the development aspect of making a portfolio, I also plan to learn from others. There are plenty of great portfolios online, so it is of my best interest to take a look at those and gather ideas on how I can make a unique profile. In other words, I need to conduct another competitor analysis. So far, the main comments I received about my portfolio is the design. I do not know how to design just yet, so I want to learn how to before I dive into changing up my portfolio. Other than that, I have not received any comments on what changes I could make immediately or in a short amount of time, which is why I have not incorporated any of my findings just yet.
