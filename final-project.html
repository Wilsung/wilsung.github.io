		<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
		<p> After completing the user research and testing, I have found that there are a few aspects my site can improve on. The main aspect is the design. As of now, my site could look more professional with a better design. Even though my site is unique, it lacks a professional sense which can be accomplished with some cleaning up. However, I have recieved notes that this is a solid starting point and I am not too far off from creating a nice, sleek portfolio. I have all the content a portfolio should contain, but now I need to update those information and elaborate a bit more. 
		<br/><br/>
		Research and testing had a few challenges. One of them was creating questions for the interviews. Me being a novice developer, I did not know what kind of questions to ask to help improve my portfolio. I wanted to keep it general and open so that I could receive constructive feedback for improvements. Another challenge was making time for the interview. My co-worker is a busy person so setting up a meeting time with him took some time. Although I could have asked other to interview, I feel like he has great experience in this field and it would be wise to ask someone who is experienced.

	<div class = "incorporation section-title container">
		<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
		<p>	Although I have not incorporated any of my findings, I am planning to do so in the future. I want to have a nice, high-end portfolio some time in the future. However, before I begin working on my portfolio, I want to begin learning more about coding and design. I feel like these aspects are important to create a unique, high-end portfolio, so I should be starting with that. I want my portfolio to incorporate as much as my knowledge as I could in order to hopefully get hired in the future. 

		<br/><br/>
		Besides learning about the development aspect of makign a portfolio, I also plan to learn from others. There are plenty of great portfolios online, so it is of my best interest to take a look at those and gather ideas on how I can make a unique profile. In other words, I need to conduct another competitor analysis. So far, the main comments I received about my portfolio is the design. I do not know how to design just yet, so I want to learn how before I dive into changing up my portfolio. Other than that, I have not received any comments on what changes I could make immediately or in a short amount of time, which is why I have no incorporated any of my findings just yet.
